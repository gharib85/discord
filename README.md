Numerical calculation for quantum discord in matlab. 
=======

This release supplies the programme discord.m with which you can numerically calculate the quantum discord for a 4x4 density matrix. The measurement was on the first qubit. The optimization over measurement is taken in von Neumann measurements.

How to use: You can direct use `discord(rho)` to calculate the discord of rho, and use `[qd,theta,phi]` to get the optimal measurement as well.
